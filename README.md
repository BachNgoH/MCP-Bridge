# MCP-Bridge
A middleware to provide an openAI compatible endpoint that can call MCP tools. MCP-Bridge acts as a bridge between the OpenAI API and MCP (MCP) tools, allowing developers to leverage MCP tools through the OpenAI API interface.

## Overview
MCP-Bridge is designed to facilitate the integration of MCP tools with the OpenAI API. It provides a set of endpoints that can be used to interact with MCP tools in a way that is compatible with the OpenAI API. This allows you to use any client with any MCP tool without explicit support for MCP. For example, see this example of using Open Web UI with the official MCP fetch tool.
